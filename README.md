## Getting started with the Exercises

- Open a new Terminal in VS Code and navigate to the workshop folder with "cd workshop/"

- Creating a Rust Project / Basic Commands

  - Run "cargo new {project_name}" (You can choose a name for the project)

  - Navigate to your new project and run "cargo build" to compile the project

  - Run "cargo run" to run the binary

    

- Move the provided "main.rs" file containing the exercises at "workshop/main.rs" into your newly created rust project src folder to "{project_name}/src/main.rs", overriding the "main.rs" that was generated by creating the project.

- For the exercises we will use the rust-analyzer VS Code extension for code completion and other features, this should be installed already

  - rust-analyzer needs VS Code to be opened directly in the Rust project folder to work, to do this while staying inside the Dev Container, in VS Code, click on "File" -> "Open Folder" and use the dialog to open the Rust project folder you created.
    
    Do NOT click on "Show Local", as this will open the Folder without the Dev Container.

- Open the main.rs in the rust project and start working on the exercises in the file underneath the main function.
